### What are loop Devices?
The loop device is a block device that maps its data blocks not to a physical device like hard disk but to the block of a regular file in a file system. These devices have no concern with ram occupation in the system.

### Define squashfs file system.
It is a read-only file system that lets you compress whole file systems or single directories, write them to other devices/partitions or to ordinary files, and then mount them 
directly (if a device) or using a loopback device (if it is a file).  For archiving purposes, SquashFS gives you a lot more flexibility and performance speed.


### What is a file extension?
A file extension or file name extension is the ending of a file that helps identify the type of file in operating systems. As an example, the file name "myfile.txt" has a file 
extension of ".txt," which is a file name extension associated with text files.


### What are linux signals?
A signal is an event generated by the UNIX and Linux systems in response to some condition. Upon receipt of a signal, a process may take action. A signal is just like an
interrupt; when it is generated at the user level, a call is made to the kernel of the OS, which then acts accordingly.
* `Maskable:` signals which can be changed or ignored by the user (e.g., Ctrl+C).
* `Non-Maskable:` signals which cannot be changed or ignored by the user. These typically occur when the user is signaled for non-recoverable hardware errors.


### Why do we have hidden files in linux?
Hidden files are the files which cotains cofiguration of that particular software. They are hidden to prevent the accidental deletion of important data.


### What is btrfs?
B Tree Filesystem is a modern copy-on-write (CoW) filesystem for Linux. Btrfs aims to implement many advanced filesystem features while focusing on fault tolerance, 
repair, and easy administration. The btrfs filesystem is designed to support the requirement of high performance and large storage servers. It is suitable for petabyte 
scale data centers as well as cellular smartphones.In this article, I am going to discuss the Btrfs filesystem and its features. So, letâ€™s get started. 


### What is swap?
Swap is a space on a disk that is used when the amount of physical RAM memory is full. When a Linux system runs out of RAM, inactive pages are moved from the RAM to the 
swap 
space. Swap space can take the form of either a dedicated swap partition or a swap file.


### Why ext4 is faster than ext3?
Ext4 supports delayed allocation & also supports multiple block allocation whereas its predecessors doesn't support any on them that's why it is faster than ext3.


### Difference between sbin & usr/sbin.
Sbin is the symbolic link of usr/sbin.


### What are swap files?
A swap file allows Linux to simulate the disk space as RAM. When your system starts running out of RAM, it uses the swap space to and swaps some content of the RAM on to the disk space. When a file is opened, it's temporary file gets generated in the same directory.


### Can 2 processes have the same process id?
NO


### Why do we have process ids?
Process identifier is a number that is used in unix/linux operating system. They are used to uniquely identify an active process.


### What is unix time sharing?
Unix is time sharing OS as its environment provides multiprogramming & multitasking. It allows a large number of users to interact concurrently. It also broght down the cost of computing capablities.


### Which process is running on which port?
sudo netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN
ss -tulpn | grep LISTEN
sudo lsof -i -P -n


### What are control groups?
cgroups or control groups is a linux kernel feature that accounts, limits the use of system resources for a collection of processes. They allow you to allocate resources like CPU time, system memory among user defined groups of  task on a system.
